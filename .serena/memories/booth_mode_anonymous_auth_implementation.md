# Booth Mode - Anonymous Authentication Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-15

### Implementation Summary
Successfully migrated booth mode from fake session injection to proper Supabase Anonymous Authentication.

### Changes Made

#### 1. BoothContext.tsx
- Updated `loginAsGuest` to use `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()`
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures
- Stores booth nickname in user metadata

#### 2. BoothNicknameModal.tsx
- Made `onSubmit` async to handle authentication promise
- Added error handling for failed authentication

#### 3. BoothModeEntry.tsx
- Updated to handle async guest join flow
- Proper error propagation

#### 4. Global.tsx
- Removed fake session injection
- Let Supabase handle anonymous auth sessions naturally
- No manual reload needed - auth state change triggers re-render

#### 5. ProfileValidator.tsx
- Continues to check for `isBoothGuest` in user metadata
- Skips profile validation for booth users

### Current Issue
**Anonymous sign-ins are disabled in Supabase**

Error: `AuthApiError: Anonymous sign-ins are disabled`

### Solution Required
Enable anonymous authentication in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
2. Find "Anonymous" provider
3. Toggle it ON
4. Save changes

### Benefits of Anonymous Auth Approach
- ✅ Security: Uses official Supabase authentication flow
- ✅ Type Safety: Real Session objects, no mocking needed
- ✅ Maintenance: Works with Supabase updates
- ✅ Scalability: Can upgrade anonymous users to full accounts later
- ✅ Compliance: Proper auth token validation

### Testing Status
- Code implementation: ✅ Complete
- Frontend flow: ✅ Working
- Authentication: ❌ Blocked (needs Supabase config)

### Next Steps
1. Enable anonymous auth in Supabase Dashboard
2. Test full booth mode flow
3. Verify party join works for anonymous users
4. Check that booth users can participate in games
