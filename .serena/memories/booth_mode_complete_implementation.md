# Booth Mode - Complete Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-15

### ✅ Full Implementation Success

Booth mode is now fully functional with Supabase Anonymous Authentication.

### Key Components Working

#### 1. Anonymous Authentication ✅
- Supabase Anonymous Auth enabled and working
- Real session tokens generated for booth users
- User metadata stores booth information:
  - `isBoothGuest: true`
  - `boothNickname: "GuestPlayer"`

#### 2. Party Join System ✅
- Booth users can join parties without accounts
- Party member list shows both regular and booth users
- No profile validation required for guests

#### 3. Stock Game Integration ✅  
- ProfileSetter.tsx updated to handle booth users
- Phase.tsx modified to use correct userId for booth users
- Booth users automatically registered in stock game
- Default gender assigned for booth users

### Technical Implementation

#### File Modifications:
1. **BoothContext.tsx**
   - `loginAsGuest()` uses `supabase.auth.signInAnonymously()`
   - Session restoration on page refresh
   - Booth user state persistence in localStorage

2. **Global.tsx**
   - SupabaseProvider wraps all components
   - Unified auth handling for regular and booth users
   - No fake session injection

3. **ProfileValidator.tsx**
   - Skips validation for booth guests
   - Checks `isBoothGuest` in user metadata

4. **ProfileSetter.tsx**
   - Detects booth users via session metadata
   - Uses booth userId instead of Supabase profile ID
   - Default gender for booth users

5. **Phase.tsx**
   - Determines correct userId based on user type
   - Supports both regular and booth users

### User Flow
1. Guest clicks "게스트로 참여"
2. Enters nickname in modal
3. Anonymous auth session created
4. Automatically joins party
5. Can participate in stock game

### Testing Results
- ✅ Guest login with nickname
- ✅ Party join without account
- ✅ Stock game participation
- ✅ Player list shows booth users
- ✅ Session persistence across refreshes

### Configuration Requirements
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Anonymous Auth must be ON
- **Backend**: Should handle booth_* user IDs

### Benefits
- No account required for party games
- Seamless booth/event experience
- Secure with real auth tokens
- Can upgrade to full accounts later
- Maintains game state properly
