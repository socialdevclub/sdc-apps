# Booth Mode Fixes - Implementation Complete

## Date: 2025-09-15

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Guest Redirect Problem ✅
**Issue**: Guests were being redirected to `/profile` after joining party
**Solution**: 
- Modified `ProfileValidator.tsx` to skip validation for booth guests
- Added check for `isBoothGuest` in user metadata
- Booth users now stay on party pages without profile validation

#### 2. Guest Routing After Join ✅  
**Issue**: After nickname submission, guests weren't properly joining the party
**Solution**:
- Implemented pending join mechanism using localStorage
- Added `useEffect` hook in `Global.tsx` to handle party join after reload
- Guest users automatically join party with their booth user ID after authentication

#### 3. Nickname Validation ✅
**Issue**: Couldn't validate nicknames against existing party member names
**Solution**:
- Added `useQueryProfileById` to fetch actual user profiles
- Enhanced validation to check both booth users and regular user nicknames
- Validates against lowercase nicknames for case-insensitive comparison

### Code Changes Summary

1. **Global.tsx**
   - Added `useJoinParty` hook for handling party joins
   - Implemented pending join logic with localStorage
   - Fixed syntax errors with proper closing brackets

2. **ProfileValidator.tsx**
   - Added booth guest detection
   - Skip profile validation for booth users
   - Fixed duplicate `const` keyword syntax error

3. **BoothNicknameModal.tsx**
   - Added profile fetching for regular users
   - Enhanced nickname validation logic
   - Fixed useQueryParty hook syntax issues
   - Proper validation against all party members

### Technical Implementation Details

- **Booth User ID Format**: `booth_${nickname}`
- **Pending Join Storage**: `BOOTH_PENDING_JOIN` in localStorage
- **Validation Flow**: Check booth users first, then regular user profiles
- **Profile Fetching**: Only fetches profiles for non-booth user IDs

### Testing Notes
- Playwright tests require `http://local.socialdev.club:5173` (not localhost)
- Test credentials: test01@socialdev.club / test1234
- Chromium browser installed for Playwright testing

### Performance Considerations
- Profile fetching only occurs for regular users (not booth users)
- Polling interval set to 1 second for real-time party updates
- Guest join attempts have 10-second timeout to prevent stale attempts

### Remaining Considerations
- Backend API could be enhanced for better nickname validation
- Consider caching user profiles for better performance
- May want to add rate limiting for nickname validation requests
